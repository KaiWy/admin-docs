msgid "In order to take a backup, it is sufficient to backup the content of MongoDB. All uploaded files are stored in the database and, therefore, covered by a database backup. MongoDB comes with built-in solutions for backups. Effektif recommends to use mongodump. For more detailed information about backups of MongoDB see the official documentation:"

msgid "You will need to use the Effektif MongoDB user credentials again to access the data of the Effektif database. If you are using another MongoDB user to perform the backups, make sure he has the necessary roles. For the backups, the user needs to access all databases and the user data. The user should have the following roles:"

msgid "You should make sure the backup is stored in a safe location and cannot get lost if the server fails. Keep in mind, the backups can consume a lot of space, therefore, you should add additional disk space to the server if you plan storing on multiple versions of the backup."

You just have to create a directory where the backups should be stored and make sure the user doing the backups has the necessary read / write permissions. If you followed the instructions within this guide to setup MongoDB, the command to execute mongodump would look like this: ::"
